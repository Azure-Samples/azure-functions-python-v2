# ai-personal-assistant

ai-personal-assistant is an Azure Function App integrating OpenAI libraries, designed to automate tasks and offer AI-driven solutions. This project harnesses the power of AI to streamline processes and enhance functionality in various applications.

## Documentation

The "ai-personal-assistant" project is an innovative solution that combines Azure Function Apps with OpenAI's advanced capabilities and Azure Cosmos DB's MongoDB API. This infrastructure is uniquely designed to develop a chatbot that utilizes emails from Outlook as its data source. The project is focused on creating a personalized, intelligent chatbot that can interact seamlessly, drawing its knowledge base directly from the user's email interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure Python Function app.
- Azure OpenAI account
- Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB - vCore Config
- Python 3.9 or higher.
- (For local development) Azure Storage emulator such as [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) running in the background

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd functions_with_openai
    ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Add the following environment variables in local.settings.json
or as app settings in Azure Function App
    - OPENAI_API_KEY -  The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource; For Open AI refer [platform API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    - OPENAI_API_TYPE - set this to `azure` for azure API
    - OPENAI_API_BASE - The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource for Azure Open AI.
    - OPENAI_API_VERSION - The API version you want to use: set this to `2022-12-01` for the released version. Refer [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#embeddings) for latest released version for embeddings.
    - OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - set this to deployment name for Azure Open AI and model name (`text-embedding-ada-002`) for Open AI API.
    - CosmosConnectionString - Connection String of Cosmos Database for Mongo DB (vCore)
    - DB_NAME - Database Name in Mongo DB
    - COLLECTION_NAME - Collection Name in the Mongo DB.
